This command allows you to control the camera in various ways, as well as interacting with other HLAE commands, such as mirv_calcs.
# Supported Games
Counter-Strike: Global Offensive

# Sub-Commands
* `mirv_cam source [...]` - Control camera location.
* `mirv_cam fov [...]` - Control camera fov.
* `mirv_cam offset [...]` - Control camera offset (in local space).

Typing any of those in the console will give you more options and often tells you what they do.
