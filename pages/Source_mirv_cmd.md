This command is useful for scheduling commands to be executed at a specific (game) time.

It's not superior to [Valve's demoui PlayCommands](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Demo_Recording_Tools#Demo_editor), so most people probably want to use Valve's demoui PlayCommands instead, which has a nice GUI. However mirv_cmd is able to save and load (XML format) independently of the demo.

# Built in command help / navigation

The manual doesn't cover all the options available through the mirv_cmd command. Basically enter the mirv_cmd command to get help for the current (sub-)command. If the help displays a subcommand with <tt>[...]</tt> behind it, then you can enter everything in-front to get more help for that sub-command.
