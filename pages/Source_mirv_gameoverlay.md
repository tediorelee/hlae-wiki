<tt>mirv_gameoverlay enable _0|1_</tt>

* **0**: disable
* **1**: enable (will only work if it was enabled initially)

Command for lazy people (you know who you are) that allows to disable / enable the gameoverlay.
This command is useful in AfxHookSource, since the gameoverlay will be recorded with startmovie otherwise.
Please note that this will not disable Steam notification sounds, but those are not recorded by startmovie anyway.
